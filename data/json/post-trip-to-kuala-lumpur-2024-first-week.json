First week","subtitle":"","description":"It's been a long time coming but it's finally here - words and pictures!\n\nAt the beginning of this year, me and my wife were able to meet up in Malaysia. It was a time well spent.\n\nI've left a TLDR at the end of this post for a list of places and activities we explored!\n\nThere is surprisingly good Yemeni/Syrian cuisine here! We had Mandi at a restaurant called Hadramawt.\n\n![Mandi](https://i.imgur.com/eYLPAwr.jpeg)\n\nWhen it comes to breakfast, cafe's are quite accessible and the quantity is decent. For two people we paid approx. 70 RM.\n\n![Breakfast at Bricks & Bread](https://i.imgur.com/HlFc51i.jpg)\n\n| | |\n|-|-|\n|![brekky1](https://i.imgur.com/3dfixs7.jpg)|![brekky2](https://i.imgur.com/pivvkEt.jpg)|\n|![brekky3](https://i.imgur.com/vzOrx64.jpg)|![brekky4](https://i.imgur.com/obz6iAb.jpg)|\n>  \n\nBut for the most part we were able to make breakfast at home.\n\nOnce we had some time we found a good rental place to get a car for a few days while we explored the city initially.\n\n![car](https://i.imgur.com/cvODjRJ.jpeg)\n\nIt helped alot being able to drive around whenever and wherever we wanted. That week we visited the cinema and watched the new Mission Impossible, visited Batu Caves, and went to Morib beach, just south of Port Klang (we got these hotdogs here and wow they were good).\n\n| | |\n|-|-|\n|![trip1](https://i.imgur.com/Hs1dgSQ.jpeg)|![trip2](https://i.imgur.com/aq1q8Z0.jpeg)|\n|![trip3](https://i.imgur.com/69iBGtF.jpeg)|![trip4](https://i.imgur.com/3uC5LNf.jpeg)|\n>  \n\n![hotdog](https://i.imgur.com/oZ2iPEb.jpeg)\n\nAlthough it didn't come without trouble! On the last day of renting the car I got a parking ticket outside our own apartment LOL!\n\n| | |\n|-|-|\n|![trip1](https://i.imgur.com/iuIu68X.jpeg)|![trip2](https://i.imgur.com/knBKGjZ.jpeg)|\n|\n>  \n\nThe next day after returning the car I was running around trying to find a way to pay the small fee, which if I didn't...would turn into a much bigger fee.\n\n---\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n*List of the places we visited during our stay*\n\n- Genting Highlands / SkyWorlds Theme Park\n- Sunway Lagoon Theme Park\n- Batu Caves\n- Berjaya Times Square\n- Explore Bukit Bintang\n- Aquaria KLCC\n- ATV Adventure Park\n- TGV Cinemas\n- Pavilion Mall\n- Central Market\n- [Hauntu (The LINC, The Curve)](https://ihauntu.com)\n\n*Cafe's*\n- Rabbit Hole\n- Hidden spot @ 9 Jalan Ceylon, Bukit\n- Bricks & Bread\n- 103° Coffee\n","author":"Faizan","date":"2024-06-06T23:15","tags":"KL Malaysia 2024 Travel Journal Food Vacation","footer":"","isPrivate":false,"createdAt":"2024-06-06T13:16:46.288Z","updatedAt":"2024-06-30T08:30:50.835Z","__v":0,"slug":"trip-to-kuala-lumpur-2024-first-week"}
